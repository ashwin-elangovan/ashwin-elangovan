### Hey Stranger ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ashwin Elangovan, a CS Graduate student at ASU. I worked as an Intern, Software Engineer and Senior Product Engineer at Freshworks which develops SaaS products to make life better for businesses!

I have a wide range of interests in software including developer tools, libraries, frameworks all the way to building products. I'm intrinsically curious and like to learn how tech works under the hood, so I tend to get involved in many things at once.
